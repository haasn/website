                            Reusable cross-platform library for GPU-accelerated real-time image and video processing.
                            Features the world's most feature-complete open source GPU color management pipeline,
                            including dynamic tone mapping with on-the-fly frame analysis, GPU film grain synthesis,
                            high-quality scaling and filtering, and more.

                        <p>
                            Full rewrite of libswscale, a widely used core FFmpeg component for pixel format conversion.
                            Developed a novel approach that combines SIMD fragments assembled at runtime to create optimized
                            conversion routines, achieving dramatic performance improvements across all supported formats
                            while reducing the size and complexity of the codebase.

                        <p>
                            Major overhaul of <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/checkasm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">checkasm</a>, a helper library for verifying correctness and benchmarking
                            SIMD routines in open source projects. Improved portability, user friendliness, and made it
                            reusable across projects. Enhanced benchmark statistics collection and analysis, enabling
                            cycle-accurate performance metrics for even very large projects in seconds rather than minutes.

                        <p>
                            Ongoing contributions focused on architectural improvements, including better format
                            negotiation, filter optimization, and development of new features. My past work spans a broad
                            domain of topics, including the first open-source implementations
                            of ITU-R H.274, AFGS1, SMPTE&nbsp;RDD5, and MV-HEVC.
