% Key Projects
\section*{Key Technical Projects}

\project{libplacebo -- Project Leader}{2017 --- Present}{
Designed and implemented comprehensive cross-platform GPU computing framework using Vulkan / OpenGL / Direct3D for real-time image processing. Features include: fully dynamic rendering pipeline, GPU film grain synthesis, high-quality scaling algorithms, and completely novel real-time tone mapping algorithm. Active and ongoing maintainership role. Used in VLC, FFmpeg, mpv, and more.
}

\project{libswscale -- Project Leader}{2024 --- 2025}{
Complete rewrite of FFmpeg's pixel format conversion code. Developed innovative approach combining SIMD fragments at runtime to generate optimized conversion routines, dramatically reducing code complexity while improving performance across all supported formats. Utilized advanced compiler techniques, including heavily templated SIMD, custom ABIs, continuation passing style and peephole optimization for code generation.
}

\project{checkasm -- Project Leader}{2025 --- Present}{
Complete refactor of the popular 'checkasm' tool, used for verifying correctness of SIMD
functions, as well as added a powerful benchmarking framework. Cleaned up
the codebase to make it fully portable, thread-safe and reusable across projects.
Major overhaul of the benchmarking and statistical evaluation subsystems to vastly
improve the quality and display of performance data, and reduce runtime by over
an order of magnitude.
}

\project{dav1d --- Developer}{2018 --- 2024}{
Experimental implementation of AV1 video decoder using Vulkan compute shaders,
exploring feasibility of fully GPU-based video decoding. Rewrote several key
DSP functions in RISC-V assembly, using RVV instructions. Implemented CPU and
GPU film grain synthesis algorithm.
